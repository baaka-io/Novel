# Novel
A website (maybe an electron app too) that provides a custom UI for wuxiaworld (and other, to be decided, novel providers) novels.

## Ideas

### General

The application will respect the theme preferences of the operating system (dark/light mode).

Fetching and searching novels will be implemented by using a headless browser. 

It might be required to introduce a cache for each novel chapter to improve the response time of the endless reading experience.

### Novel Searching

Novel Searching will be realised by using the [novelupdates](https://novelupdates.com) website

### Novel Reader

The Novels themself will be read in an infinite scroll manner. 
The next chapter gets loaded automatically when needed, to provide a seemless experience when reading your favorite novels.
The Novel Reader should also make the comments of each chapter available for the reader (I've had a lot of fun experiences in the past only because of the commments, so this is a must have).
Writing comments over the website might be hard or even not possible. This is not in the scope of the project since I am always lurking and not writing anyway.
